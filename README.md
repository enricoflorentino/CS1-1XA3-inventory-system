# CS1-1XA3-inventory-system
This project is a GUI-based inventory system created in Python. In this GUI, the user has the ability to create new items that can be saved to the inventory, search the inventory for existing items, and delete items from the inventory. Also, via text files (.txt), the user is given the ability to save a whole inventory worth of items into a file, and can also load an inventory from a file.
